```

## Nginx usage example

Let's assume that you have authorization application on the port 3333 and file
server on unix socket `/var/run/file-storage.sock`. Nginx configuration example:

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name file-storage.your.domain;

    access_log /usr/local/var/log/nginx/file-storage/access.log;
    error_log /usr/local/var/log/nginx/file-storage/error.log notice;

    location /auth {
        internal;

        proxy_pass "http://localhost:3333";
        proxy_method GET;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_pass_request_body off;
        proxy_set_header Content-Length "";

        # Set original request values uri and method to make
        # authorization though.
        proxy_set_header X-Original-Uri $request_uri;
        proxy_set_header X-Original-Method $request_method;
    }

    location / {
        auth_request /auth;

        # Use unix socket to avoid direct access from network
        proxy_pass "http://unix:/var/run/file-storage.sock";
    }
}
```
